            <h2>Welcome to the Game Mechanics page</h2>
                <p>
                    This page contains a brief overview of Zenless Zone Zero's combat mechanics, along with some
                    screenshots to help the reader better understand the information. The mechanics might be
                    difficult to understand when you first start playing, so this page is just ment to explain things
                    in a simpler perspective.

                <h3>Actions</h3>

                <p>
                    In combat you can preform a selection of actions at your leisure, said actions are as follows;
                    Basic Attack, Skill, dodge/dash, swap/ parry, and Ultimate. you can only use these actions
                    durring combat, and there are no real cooldowns on the actions, but there are energy meters
                    for both the Skill (EX Skill) and Ultimate (EX Ultimate), refer to the image below for better
                    understanding.

                <h3>EX Abilities</h3>
                <p>
                    EX Abilities are easily explained as a stronger version of both the Skill and Ultimates, doing
                    more damage, strengthining the character in some way, or allowing a character to deal damage even
                    when
                    they are not on the field. You will know when the EX Abilitiy can be used when the icon changes
                    color, you can also see how much energy you currently have for your EX Abilities by looking
                    in the top-left corner of the screen (see image below).

                <p>
                    The image above shows the EX Skill meter with the pink and blue gradent bar unter the current
                    character's
                    health bar, and the EX Ultimate meter in numbers (3000 is when the meter is full)
