                    This page contains a brief overview of Zenless Zone Zero's combat mechanics, along with some
                    screenshots to help the reader better understand the information. The mechanics might be
                    difficult to understand when you first start playing, so this page is just ment to explain things
                    in a simpler perspective.

                    Basic Attack, Skill, dodge/sprint, assist, and Ultimate. you can only use these actions
                    durring combat, and there are no real cooldowns on the actions, but there are energy meters
                    for both the Skill (EX Skill) and Ultimate (EX Ultimate)
